Emergency cesarean section at 37 weeks; denies ADNPM; denies sleep alterations; denies preexisting diseases, accidents, or significant events. Reports of sialorrhea due to hypotonia until 3 years old, requiring speech therapy intervention; presence of significant allergic condition. Difficulty using the bathroom.

Reports that "when I was left in an environment with an unknown person, no matter how short the time absent (like a trip to the bathroom), I would fall into a deep sleep unexpectedly, regardless of the time (sic)".

In early childhood education, he was shy, preferring to play with rhymes rather than classmates. Soon after, he started socializing with peers, being part of the `"group of weirdos"`. Outside the school environment, socialization was smoother.

In regular schooling, `he did not present difficulties in acquiring formal knowledge, despite low concentration`. The `difficulties with attention/concentration persisted during higher education, compromising the excellence of results`. Currently maintains stable interests, hobbies, and social relationships despite preferring to alternate with moments of isolation to "recharge social batteries (sic)". Occasionally (especially when introduced to large groups or among unknown people), he feels social discomfort.

He presents autonomy for daily living skills (ADLs), despite `difficulties with organization and planning (Executive Functions)`, especially those that do not provide immediate satisfaction.

## Activities, games, and tests:

### Intelligence

Luis Paulo was subjected to the `Nonverbal Intelligence Test - G-38¹`, which aims to evaluate the general intelligence factor `(Factor g)`. Intelligence is defined as the ability to solve problems, relate ideas, and deal with difficulties that arise in daily activities. This instrument evaluates the result obtained by individuals in terms of percentile. As a statistical measure of sample distribution of performance, percentile is the value that represents the percentage of people who achieve a certain score, or less, on the instrument. For example, the result of an evaluated person was 30 and the percentile that corresponds to this result was 75. This means that 75% of the people who respond to this instrument usually score less than or equal to 30. In other words, only 25% of people usually achieve a score higher than 30.

¹ Boccalandro, E.R. (2002). G38 Nonverbal Intelligence Test. São Paulo: Vetor.

`Luis Paulo` was subjected to the `G-38` and obtained a total `raw score of 30 points`, which corresponds to the `70th percentile`. This result indicates that Luis Paulo can solve problems, relate ideas, and acquire new knowledge, meaning his `intelligence capacity is within the average` compared to the normative sample.

## Emotional Intelligence / Personality

Personality plays a fundamental role in our way of being, thinking, and acting, being essential to understand it for greater self-knowledge and personal development.

### Hexadimensional Personality Inventory (IPHEXA)²

An instrument specifically designed to capture and measure personality traits in the six domains of the HEXACO model: Openness to experience, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotionality, Extraversion, and Honesty-Humility. Through this evaluation, it is possible to obtain a precise and comprehensive view of individual characteristics, identify strengths, areas of growth, and build healthier and more effective relationships. Below are essential points of the evaluation. The full document is available to the evaluated in the attachment to this report.


![Evaluation Results](personality/plots/radar_chart_facet_evaluation.png)








### SUMMARY OF RESULTS 

**OPENNESS TO EXPERIENCE:** The observed characteristics suggest a `significant expression of creativity`, with a `lesser tendency to explore new information` or adopt unconventional perspectives. `This profile stands out for its expressive creative ability but with less interest in exploring areas outside its usual scope.` It is important to value the creative expression of this profile and encourage it to explore new areas of knowledge, even if this is not aligned with a more intense curiosity or eccentric behaviors. `Most of the time, this profile tends to present focused thinking` and a more conventional approach to challenges and problems. `This combination can result in an ability to generate creative ideas in an established context.`

**AGREEABLENESS:** At this moment, tends to `face challenging situations with less patience`, demonstrating a more direct and assertive posture. Additionally, `may have difficulty in leave behind resentments and past grievances`, showing a tendency to maintain a lower posture of forgiveness. Regarding tenderness, prefers to deal with others in a balanced way, showing a moderate disposition to express affection and empathy. This combination of characteristics suggests that `this person can have their own way of relating to others`, being able to face challenges in seeking positive and balanced relationships.

**CONSCIENTIOUSNESS:** Characteristics related to Conscientiousness suggest a moderate preference for seeking order in the physical environment, a `reasonable concern with meticulousness and details`, and a `lower tendency to carefully ponder before acting and inhibit impulses`. This combination suggests a `balanced approach` of the individual in relation to organization, being `neither overly rigid nor totally disorganized`. They may have reasonable attention to details but may tend to act more spontaneously, without prolonged reflection.

**EMOTIONALITY:** The observed combination in the domain of Emotionality reveals a `low tendency to worry about a variety of issues`, a `low need for emotional support from others`, and a lower sensitivity to feel strong emotional bonds with other people. This combination suggests that the person may have a `more calm and less anxious approach to situations`, not depending so much on emotional support from others and `maintaining a certain emotional distance in their relationships`.

**EXTRAVERSION:** At this moment, it is observed that the individual has a `medium level of social boldness`, which suggests that they may experience `both comfort and some discomfort in varied social situations`. Regarding sociability, their classification is low, indicating a `preference for solitary activities` rather than more intense social interactions, such as conversations and parties. In relation to the `facet of liveliness`, the evaluation is also low, which suggests that they `tend not to frequently experience states of joy or dynamism`. Therefore, this combination points to a person who tends not to feel completely comfortable in certain social situations, demonstrates a more solitary approach, and `does not show a high level of enthusiasm or energy in their daily life.`

**HONESTY - HUMILITY:** At this moment, reveals a `very high tendency to modesty`, indicating a modest and unassuming posture. Additionally, there is a `moderate tendency towards sincerity`, suggesting a `propensity to act in a genuine and transparent way in interpersonal relationships`. This combination indicates that the person values modesty and seeks to act authentically and sincerely in their interactions with others.

### Online Emotional Intelligence Battery – BOLIE
A self-report inventory aimed at assessing cognitive and personality aspects related to emotional intelligence.

In global emotional intelligence `(BOLIE-T)`, he scored `QIE: 84 and Percentile: 14`. This result indicates a `low capacity to regulate emotions and knowledge of one's own emotional states`. It may be related to a `low ability to recognize emotional expressions in others`, experiencing positive emotions, life satisfaction, quality of life, fluid and crystallized intelligence, commitment, and job satisfaction.

### SUMMARY OF RESULTS

**COMPREHENSION:** Average ability to understand why emotions arise and how they transition and blend over time. It may also be related to an `average ability to adequately recognize emotional expressions in others`, fluid and crystallized intelligence, empathy, and positive social interactions.

**MANAGEMENT:** Average (tending to high) ability to regulate emotions, knowledge of one's own emotional states, experiencing positive emotions, life satisfaction, and quality of life. It may be related to an `average (tending to high)` ability for positive social interactions, commitment, and job satisfaction.

**POSITIVITY:** May be related to an `average (tending to high)` capacity to regulate emotions, life satisfaction, quality of life, experiencing positive affects, positive social interactions, availability for others, commitment, and job satisfaction.

**EMOTIONAL REGULATION - TOTAL:** `Average (tending to low)` capacity to regulate emotions, knowledge of one's own emotional states, experiencing positive affects, life satisfaction, and quality of life. May be related to an `average (tending to low)` capacity for positive social interactions, commitment, and job satisfaction.

**CONTROL OF IMPULSIVITY AND IRRITABILITY:** `Average (tending to low)` capacity to control impulsivity and irritability, i.e., `capacity (tending to low)` to manage anger, irritation, and impulse control.

**CONTROL OF EMOTIONAL OVERLOAD:** `Average (tending to low)` capacity to control emotional overload, i.e., `capacity (tending to low)` to manage excessive negative emotions and stress overload.

**RESILIENCE:** `Average (tending to low)` resilience capacity, i.e., `average (tending to low)` capacity to tolerate stressful situations.

**SOCIABILITY:** Very low capacity for positive social interactions. May be related to a `very low` capacity to regulate emotions, knowledge of one's own emotional states, and life satisfaction.

**TOHE-S (Sociability):** May be related to `very low` capacity for empathy, positive social interactions, experiencing positive affects, capacity to regulate emotions, knowledge of one's own emotional states, life satisfaction, and quality of life.

**QoE-T (Empathy - total):** `Average (tending to low)` capacity for empathy and positive social interactions. May be related to `average (tending to low)` capacity to understand why emotions arise and how they transition and blend over time, to regulate emotions, knowledge of one's own emotional states, experiencing positive affects, life satisfaction, quality of life, commitment, and job satisfaction.

**RESPONSIVENESS:** `Average (tending to low)` capacity for responsiveness (affective empathy), i.e., `average (tending to low)` capacity to experience the same emotions as others are experiencing.

**RESPECT:** `Average (tending to high)` capacity for respect (cognitive empathy), i.e., `average (tending to high)` capacity to rationally understand what other people are feeling, their intentions, and motives, without necessarily having to experience the same.

**AVAILABILITY:** `Average` capacity for availability (compassionate empathy), i.e., intention to help and avoid unpleasant things happening to others.

**EMOTIONAL VELOCITY:** `Average` reaction speed to stimuli of emotional value. It may also be related to an `average` capacity for fluid intelligence.

- As we can observe from the presented results, the worst index for the examined person refers to sociability. However, their responsiveness and availability indices fall within the expected pattern. Thus, this result may be better explained by statistical randomness.

*For aid in interpreting the results, consider that scores above ninety are within the typical range; between 80 and 90 are classified as borderline and warrant attention; below 70 are classified as inferior and commonly indicate clinical deficits.*

## Perception and visual memory

### Test of Copy and Reproduction of Memory of Complex Geometric Figures

Evaluates the neuropsychological functions of visual perception and immediate memory in two phases - copy and memory reproduction - thus verifying how the evaluated person learns the perceptual data presented to them and what is spontaneously conserved by memory.

Luis Paulo presented a type of copy **within the expected range for an adult pattern**, constructing the drawing from a base trace. The result of the copy process, however, indicates **performance below the lower average in visual construction skills (percentile 25-5)**, with many omissions and rotations in the form, indicating prejudice in the ability of planning and spatial organization.

Luis Paulo obtained the **lower classification in the immediate visual memory ability (percentile 10)**, with significant omissions and rotations. This result suggests deficits in immediate visual memory ability, where the person presents an absence of preservation of forms and locations of elements.

*Commonly, people with ADHD present a memory reproduction process at lower levels than the copy process, given that disorganization and lack of focus influence the ability to retain information. However, the examined person showed changes in both the form and location that are more significant than expected.*

*Investigation of Visual Processing is suggested.*

---

## Recognition Memory Test (TEM-R-2)

The examined person was subjected to the **Recognition Memory Test – TEM-R-2**. Memory is the process by which people store and access information from the past to use it in the present. Specifically regarding recognition memory, it refers to the ability to identify any type of stimulus or situation already visualized or experienced previously.

Luis Paulo was subjected to the TEM-R-2 and obtained a total **raw score of 16 points**, which corresponds to the **10th percentile**.

| Points | Percentile | Classification |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| 16     | 10         | Inferior       |

| Hits | Errors |
|------|-------|
| 19   | 3     |

*Table used: Percentiles - 2021 - High School / Higher Education - State of Santa Catarina*

*This result suggests that Luis Paulo presents a recognition memory below average compared to people from the normative sample, which indicates considerable difficulty in identifying any stimulus or situation already visualized or experienced previously. Considering the job functions he intends to perform, it is interesting to verify to what extent this difficulty can interfere in his daily activities.*

---

## Perception and Auditory Memory

Luis Paulo was subjected to the **RAVLT – Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test⁴**, which is a neuropsychological test that uses a list of simple words, of high frequency in Brazilian Portuguese, with steps of immediate recall, delayed recall, and a recognition task.

Evaluating memory is an aspect of great relevance in the processes of psychological and neuropsychological assessment, as the deficit of this cognitive function can compromise daily activities and formal learning at many levels.

The **RAVLT** is one of the most used instruments for the assessment of declarative episodic memory, widely known in several countries, contributing to diagnoses that include memory difficulty.

⁴ Paula, J., Malloy-Diniz (2018). Teste de Aprendizagem Auditivo-verbal de Rey (RAVLT). 1ed. – São Paulo: Vetor.

The test aids in clinical diagnosis, contributing to the identification of the type of memory difficulty, indicating indices such as greater difficulty in storage or retrieval of information.

| Ability                                       | Description                                                                 | Performance  |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Short-term verbal memory                      | Ability to temporarily retain a verbally presented content                  | Typical      |
| Short-term episodic verbal memory             | Ability to remember an event that happened recently and was verbally expressed | Typical      |
| Long-term episodic verbal memory              | Ability to remember a previously experienced event verbally expressed       | Typical      |
| Recognition memory                            | Memory of recognizing previously learned content through repeated exposures | Typical      |
| Global learning measure                       | Ability to learn a verbally repeated content over time                      | Typical      |
| Retention index                               | Ability to retain information after a passage of time, including exposure to new and different contexts | Typical      |
| Proactive interference index                  | Reflects difficulty in learning new information after automatization of previously learned content | Difficulties |
| Retroactive interference index                | Ability to retain previously learned information after new content is presented | Typical      |

*As we can observe from the above figure, the examined person presented quite efficient performance in the presented tasks, with performance above average in most of the items. However, according to the instrument, despite an excellent learning curve, the information fades (is forgotten) quite significantly.*

*This result, combined with the previous test (Complex Figures by Rey), seems to indicate a memory retention difficulty for visually and auditorily presented information.*

*Despite mnemonic activities showing a natural decline in performance over chronological time, it is not expected that this picture manifests in the examined person's age. It is suggested to start a memory rehabilitation process for preventive purposes.*

## Attention

Luis Paulo was subjected to the `AOL Battery - Online Attention`. Attention is the ability to identify the most important stimuli and discard those that, at that moment, are irrelevant to the task the individual is performing.

This ability is essential in various everyday situations such as: reading a book, studying for an exam, attending a class, preparing dinner, watching a movie, among others. These are examples of actions that will be performed with quality if the individual is able to maintain focus on them.

In this test, Luis Paulo presented `attention skills within the average`. As we can see in the table below, the reaction time to stimuli was also effective, showing that Luis Paulo has preserved processing speed, i.e., `average ability to respond to the presented activities`.

| Ability                | Raw Score | Percentile | Classification | Time  | Time Classification |
|------------------------|-----------|------------|----------------|-------|---------------------|
| Alternating Attention  | 48.0      | 25         | Lower Average  | 1.9s  | Very Fast           |
| Concentrated Attention | 59.0      | 70         | Higher Average | 1.48s | Very Fast           |
| Divided Attention      | 37.5      | 50         | Average        | 4.61s | Average             |

*It is interesting to analyze this result in light of the concentration difficulties presented by the examinee and their previous ADHD diagnosis. We would commonly expect to find deficits in attention capacity and, especially, in processing speed.*

*However, it is known that adults can present adequate performance in attention tests applied in a controlled environment (free of competing stimuli). These individuals usually present their greatest deficits in Executive Functions. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the examinee is under medicinal treatment, with medication for primary symptom control.*

*It is also pertinent to observe that response time (processing speed) decreases as testing progresses. In this test, we can infer that in longer tasks, attention quality may be lost.*

---

## Executive Functions

The `FDT - Five Digits Test`⁶ is an instrument that allows for the brief and simple assessment of cognitive processing speed, the ability to focus and redirect attention, and the capacity to deal with interferences.

The examinee presented `significant difficulties in the automatic processes of reading and in the automatic counting processes`, which are actions related to the rapid issuance of responses already consolidated, representative of simple attentional processes.

In the evaluation of executive attention control, named in this instrument as controlled processes, Luis Paulo obtained performance `below average in choice and alternation processes`. These processes refer to the domain of intentional attention (when we identify the stimulus and act on what we should do).

The processes that evaluated executive initiation functions showed indications of difficulties. In contrast, cognitive flexibility indicated performance within the average.

*This test is a simple procedure that does not require prior academic knowledge beyond counting from 1 to 5. However, the executive processes referred to here involve complex processes, which require high mental control, thus mobilizing a superior level of mental resources.*

Luis Paulo was subjected to the `Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale (BDEFS)`⁷, which assesses possible deficits in Executive Functions (EF) in daily activities in adults.

These processes are responsible for guiding, directing, and generating cognitive functions. The EF term represents a construct that includes a collection of interrelated functions responsible for intentional behavior, aimed at objectives and problem-solving.

Among the evaluated functions are: `Time Management; Organization and Problem Solving; Self-Control; Self-Motivation; Emotional Self-Regulation`. With a strong theoretical basis, the material is classified as gold standard.

This scale aims to evaluate deficits in executive functions, emphasizing the frequency of occurrence of executive dysfunction symptoms in daily life. While there is no universal definition for executive functions, there is a consensus that they are based on intentional behavior, directly linked to the capacity for behavior management, leaving less room for automatic behavior.

The executive processes referred to here involve complex processes, which require high mental control, thus mobilizing a superior level of mental resources.

Luis Paulo presented, in general terms, adequate performance. Motivation and the general assessment of executive functioning symptoms indicated difficulties without necessarily indicating a clinical condition.

*Executive functions are cognitive processes related to intentional behavior and are crucial for our adaptation. These functions in our daily life are essential for planning, problem-solving, and regulating our actions.*

---

*Executive functions allow us to solve problems considering the short, medium, and long-term consequences of the chosen solution.*
*In this way, the importance of executive functions for success in school, work, and our personal relationships becomes evident.*
*This brain region is related to planning behaviors and complex thoughts, personality expression, decision-making, and modulation of social behavior. The basic activity of this region is the result of thoughts and actions according to internal goals. These skills are known as Executive Functions.*

**Impulsivity Evaluation**

The main definitions of impulsivity include an inability to assess a risky situation, a preference for immediate rewards, and difficulty in planning and foreseeing consequences. Impulsivity is characterized by quick action, a tendency to respond rapidly to a stimulus without prior reflection, difficulty in maintaining attention for a prolonged time, and difficulty in planning actions and an absence of forethought. It can also be associated with intuitive and spontaneous behaviors. Below are the quantitative results, showing the percentile achieved by the evaluated person in each of the four factors assessed by the scale: Lack of Concentration and Persistence, Cognitive Control, Future Planning, and Boldness and Recklessness, as well as the interpretation of the achieved result.

| Scales                           | Points | Classification     | Percentile |
|----------------------------------|--------|--------------------|------------|
| Lack of concentration and persistence | 44     | Extreme Superior | 99         |
| Cognitive control                | 24     | Low                | 10         |
| Future planning                  | 19     | Medium             | 50         |
| Audacity and boldness            | 14     | Medium             | 50         |


![Evaluation Results](personality/plots/esavi-a_7.png)


### Results:

**Lack of concentration and persistence - Extreme Superior:** Luis Paulo shows extreme difficulty in dealing with everyday demands regarding completing tasks he has started, as he appears dispersed and distracted, potentially compromising the results of tasks entrusted to him, putting the completion of his duties at risk.

**Cognitive control - Low:** In daily life, he may act hastily without thinking of prior strategies in the face of presented issues. It also indicates little care in the way he expresses himself and a reduced capacity to analyze situations that require decision-making.

---

### Future Planning - Medium:

Shows an ability to reflect and project actions based not only on immediate consequences but also on the impact and implications these will have for third parties in the future.

### Boldness and Recklessness - Medium:

Tends to assess the risks of situations in which he is involved concerning himself and others. Therefore, tends to be more prudent in actions, with the capacity to respond satisfactorily when immediate responses are required.

Luis Paulo responded to the `Adult Self-Report Scale (ASRS - 18)`. This questionnaire was developed by researchers in collaboration with the World Health Organization for screening symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults. This is the validated version in Brazil. This instrument indicates clinical criteria for ADHD diagnosis.

### ADHD Functional Impairment Scale (EPF-TDAH):

A specific scale for ADHD that encompasses functional impairments considered typical and relevant to the population in question. The primary objective of this scale is to explore the functional impairments related to the disorder that adults may experience in important areas of daily life. These areas include Academic, Professional, Social, Affective-Sexual, Domestic, Financial, Health, Traffic, and Legal Risk. These areas are listed as criteria B in the DSM-5. This instrument indicates consistent functional impairments in academic, professional, and social areas. These are the areas impacted required for the ADHD diagnosis according to DSM-V manuals.

### Baptist Depression Scale (EBEDEP):

Evaluates the presence of depressive symptoms, independent of previous diagnosis, being a tool in tracking and assisting in detecting depressive disorders and/or clinically significant depressive symptoms. Depressive disorders are frequently considered recurrent and persistent, with depressive symptoms being able to appear and disappear independently of the presence of disorders (humor or any others). Thus, with a dimensional vision of depression symptoms, in all its nuances, it may present variation according to intensity, duration, and frequency.

---

Luis Paulo was subjected to the `EBEDEP-A` and obtained a total raw score of `29 points`, corresponding to the `29th percentile`. This result suggests that the examinee is in the category of `minimal depressive symptomatology`. This category generally represents people who have few symptoms in terms of frequency, duration, and intensity, indicating that they do not experience significant psychological suffering. It is relatively expected that people have some minimal symptoms assessed by the `EBEDEP-A`, even if they do not present a diagnostic hypothesis for depressive disorders.

## Observations and Directed Activities

During the evaluation, Luis Paulo showed himself motivated, responsive, and quite collaborative. The directed tasks for verifying the `Theory of Mind` and `Central Coherence Theory` showed typical performance in the domain of pragmatic content, sub-level elements of speech, metaphors, ironies, etc., with good comprehension and use of these resources.

Luis Paulo presented typically encountered `shared attention`. Shared attention `(AC)` is defined as the ability to coordinate attention between two people regarding a shared direction - object or two people - for the purpose of sharing a common experience.

The observation of the above-mentioned skills is part of the clinical examination and is fundamental in the evaluation of suspected `ASD of high functionality` in adults, since they are intrinsically associated with this pathology and, as a rule, define it.
